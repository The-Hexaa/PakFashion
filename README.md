## Overview

The **Fashion Brand Query Bot** is a Streamlit application that allows users to search and explore fashion items from brands like Khaadi, Sapphire, Generation, and Rang Ja. Users can ask the bot questions about various fashion items, and the bot will respond with relevant details.

## Features

- Search for fashion items by color, type, or brand.
- Display detailed information about each item, including price and description.
- Visual display of the item images within the Streamlit app.
- Easy-to-use interface powered by Streamlit.

    git clone git@github.com:The-Hexaa/PakFashion.git 
    ```

    cd PakFashion
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
